# This is my practice of github to manage a local poject along with github 

There are some directories you need to know like 

cd <-name of file/folder-> : if you want to go inside that particular file or folder.

cd .. : to come out or go back.

mkdir : to make new directory 

#1. init command : to initialize git inside that folder/ project 

# Understanding branches:

commands: git branch

    git branch -M main

    git checkout <-branch name->

    git branch -d <-branch name->

    git checkout -b <-new branch name->
